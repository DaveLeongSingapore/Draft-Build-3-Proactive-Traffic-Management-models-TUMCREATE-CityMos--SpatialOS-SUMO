# Proactive-Traffic-Management
## Summary: focus on forecasting traffic congestions proactively before they happen and making data driven decisions(less than 30 secs) with analytics to combat them
### Goals
### Develop 3 experimental models(TUMCreate CityMos, SpatialOS, SUMO) for proactive traffic events-driven decisions. This repo will contribute in 2 cutting edge,computer science fields: AI(Machine Learning) & Massive Scale, Cloud Based stimulation (300K agents)
#### 1. Develop reinforcement learning and deep learning concepts, implement and evaluate them in stimulation and testing under real conditions for 3 stimulations apps
#### 2. Devises machine learning and neural network algorithms and architectures to best exploit cloud based, massive scale simulation architecture
#### 3. Develope techniques for read time visualization and explanation for images, speech, structured and unstructured data
